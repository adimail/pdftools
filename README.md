PDFTools is a collection of Python utilities designed for PDF automation. It includes scripts for grayscale and color inversion for PDF files. This project aims to provide simple tools for working with PDFs and can be extended to include other automation tasks in the future. I love ILovePDF, but I noticed there are some tasks that certain software can’t handle, which require a more hands-on approach. My sister needed to print some lecture notes, but the teacher had provided them with notes that had a black background, and the printer refused to print them, saying it would look bad. She asked me for help, and I knew I could first convert the PDF to grayscale and then invert the colors (black to white, white to black) to make the text readable. The online tools I found were too slow, and they uploaded the files to a server, which I didn’t like. I don’t understand why online PDF and multimedia tools don’t use technologies like WASM to handle operations on the client side. So, I wrote these simple scripts to accomplish this task, and my sister was happy with the results. I will be adding more scripts as needed. Perhaps I will move this to my serious list soon.
